# Progress

## What Works

### Prototype

- Basic BlockNote editor implemented with minimal configuration
- Text editing capability with default BlockNote setup
- Initial AI integration with OpenAI for generating questions
- Core functionality to create and manage notes and blocks
- Modular code structure with separation of concerns:
  - Custom hooks for note management and search functionality
  - OpenAI service for AI-related operations
  - Utility functions for operations like similarity calculations

### Final App

- Production-ready, scalable, with user accounts, data persistence, and advanced features.

## What's Left to Build

### Prototype

- Re-implement features with BlockNote in phases:
  1. Block manipulation (create, delete, move)
  2. AI integration and content processing
  3. Search functionality
  4. Block linking system
  5. Advanced UI features (drag indicators, styling)
- Performance testing with larger document sizes

### Final App

- Backend: Set up Node.js/Express server. Integrate MongoDB, define schemas.
- Auth: Add Firebase Auth, secure routes.
- Features: Implement notifications, insights. Add slash commands to TipTap.
- Testing: Unit tests for API endpoints. E2E tests for UI (Cypress).
- Deployment: Deploy to Vercel, set up CI/CD.

## Current Status

- App.tsx has been successfully refactored from 241 lines to under 100 lines
- Type safety has been improved across the application
- Code architecture follows best practices with separation of concerns
- Application functionality remains intact while being more maintainable

## Known Issues

### Prototype

- Previous features (AI integration, search, links) temporarily disabled during BlockNote migration
- Need to redesign some features to work with BlockNote's architecture
- Type-safe integration with BlockNote needs improvement
- Event handlers (content changes, Enter key, etc.) need to be re-implemented

### Final App

- Document any known issues or bugs.
- Provide details on their impact and potential solutions.

## Refactoring

- App.tsx has been successfully refactored to be more modular:
  - Extracted cosineSimilarity function to utils/similarity.ts
  - Moved OpenAI functionality to services/openAIService.ts
  - Created custom hooks for notes (useNotes.tsx) and search (useSearch.tsx)
- All TypeScript type errors have been resolved:
  - Added proper typing for state setter functions
  - Ensured consistency in props interfaces
  - Fixed generic type issues in custom hooks
