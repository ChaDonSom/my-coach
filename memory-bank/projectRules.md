# Project Rules

- All project files must be no more than 200 lines.
- Maintain a clean and up-to-date memory bank; refer to it regularly to ensure compliance with project guidelines.
  // Rule: Files can be max 150 lines long. Files longer should be thoughtfully, sensibly broken out, by their most critical concepts first.
